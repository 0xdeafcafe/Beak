*You may have to run `yarn rebuild` to get NodeGit to work, depending on your system installed version of Node. tbh, It's safer to just always run it.*

## Common issues

### A new `BrowserWindow` is instantiated but no window is created?

If you've been fucking with `chrome-sandbox`, trying to get it working through WSL, it'll end up totally fucked. I've added a quick workaround for this, just run `yarn unfuck` in the root of the repo and it'll clean up everything for you.
